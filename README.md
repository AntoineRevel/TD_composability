# ESILV TD Composability Project

This repository hosts my implementation for the ESILV engineering school's TD Composability project. The work is based on the exercises outlined in [AymericNoel's TD_composability](https://github.com/AymericNoel/TD_composability).

## Contents

- Solidity contracts for ERC20 and ERC721 tokens.
- Scripts for deployment and interaction with Ethereum contracts.

## Etherscan Verification

View my solution's verification on Etherscan [here](<https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x7613F2c18Da470486Dee09160B221E11D506b9B2?fbclid=IwAR0DH543JaV-80SX547tU_XAGem7o-xSggchsz6-jq-c3UwAr-QosM5A64A#code>).

## Usage

Use `test_deploy.sh` and `deploy_and_verify.sh` for testing and verifying contracts.
